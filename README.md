    7)	Git clone https://github.com/vaibahvmathur/TechEdison                   GIT BASH
    8)	change directory to  TechEdison/techapp (project folder)                CMD
    9)  put the Tracking-Log.txt file in TechEdison\techapp folder under name log.txt
    10) cd TechEdision (Project folder) 				  					    CMD
    11)	Python manage.py runserver					                            CMD

Question :
	  
    Create a web application and return the expected results via API.

		1.) Totally how many videos each user has played.

		2.) Totally how many courses each user has enrolled.




Logic :

    1)  read user id ( let be uid ) :
 		      a)  go through json data  
		      b)  if userid = uid and event_name = play_video  
                 than increase play_video_counter by 1  with respect to uid

    2) read user id ( let be uid) :
          a) go through json data
          b) if userid = uid and course id = x  
                 get all unique course id list ( i,e  { uid : [x,y,z] } ) 
                 total course for uid = len( uid_course_list)
 
 
 
                     
Result :  
	
	1)  http://127.0.0.1:8000/techapp/log   API test in POSTMAN for post request
	2)  http://127.0.0.1:8000/techapp/graph   webbrowser
